# Landing Page Project

## Description
This project dynamically builds a navigation menu based on sections in the HTML, highlights sections in the viewport, and smoothly scrolls to sections when navigation items are clicked.

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the navigation menu to scroll to different sections.
3. Scroll to see the active section highlighted.
4. Click the "Top" button to scroll back to the top of the page.

## How it works
- JavaScript dynamically creates navigation items based on sections.
- The active section is highlighted based on its visibility in the viewport.
- Smooth scrolling to sections is implemented using `scrollIntoView`.
- A "Scroll to top" button is provided for quick navigation to the top of the page.

## Dependencies
- Web browser that supports JavaScript.
- Internet connection (for Google Fonts and any external libraries used).

## Installation
There is no special installation required. Simply clone the repository and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
